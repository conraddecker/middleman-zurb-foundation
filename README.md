# Middleman Template: ZURB Foundation #

Middleman-Foundation is a [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with the [Compass](http://compass-style.org) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) version of the [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

Currently works with Foundation 4.1.6 and utilizes the fantastic [CodeSync](http://datapimp.github.io/code_sync/) project for live asset reloading.

## Installation ##

Make sure to have:

1. ruby
2. git
3. middleman ($ `gem install middleman`)
4. zurb foundation ($ `gem install zurb-foundation`)

Clone into ~/.middleman (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

1. $ `git clone git://github.com/conraddecker/middleman-zurb-foundation.git ~/.middleman/zurb-foundation`
2. $ `middleman init my_new_project --template=zurb-foundation`
